Hello and welcome to Unit Converter v1.0.2!!

To use: select desired units from the dropdown menus, input values and enjoy the
beautiful scenery

Unit Converter can convert between different units and is heavily inspired
by google's unit converter.

Conversions are automatically calculated when either of the values change or either
of the units are changed.

When I completed the unit converter part I was left with a lot of empty space so
I filled it with an image view that flips through a few image resource files. I wanted
to get familiar with animations and timed events in Android studio so I decided to
try it out although it does not add much functionality to the app.

I then added the option to switch between three different unit types: weight, length, and
time to add some more functionality to the app because it felt a bit underwhelming.

I still wasn't satisfied with the random images as a useful graphic so I decided
to use the Graphview library to plot the relationship between units. Although the
graph proves to not be very helpful since the conversions are extremely simple,
it makes a bit more sense than fish measurement guides. I decided to keep the image
at the bottom because it adds some flavor and I spent the most time working on it.

Work Breakdown:
Day 1:
    Worked on UI layout, got spinners and text boxes placed and populated, but nothing
    interactive
Day 2:
    Began working on interactivity, allowing the user to change between units using
    spinners, but the conversion code was not written
Day 3:
    Finished the conversion code for length, but app was too simple
Day 4:
    Added the image view
Day 5:
    Added more unit types and the graph
